SOLARPUNK FUTURES
Haziasoft

A device/game for thinking through some preposterous problems to do with:

* the relationship of social research to meaningful positive change
* the role of technologies in informing the practices of social life
* the possibility of supporting resistance and activism through design/games
* ...more?

None of this may work, it might all be a dead end, but it's an attempt to
apply some skills and expertises I have to something genuine and important.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

-----------------------------------

NOTE:
This code is not going to work unless you have the exact same device as I have
in my office connected up to it, which is...unlikely (since the device is a
Frankenstein's monster of Raspberry Pi Phats). I'm going to produce something
of an instruction manual for the game and the device which will demonstrate
how to replicate the device such that this code will run on it, but that's not
ready yet. This code is, at present, just here as a backup and a way of
demonstrating just what the flipping heck I think I'm up to. Get in touch
with me if you want to talk more about it in the meantime though!

TO DO LIST:
* Modularise out the scenario/memo data
* Write another stage in a game round, yearly net +/- everyday resource usage
* Design and 3D print the case (and test it's OK for the device)
* Write a game manual, change About screen to link to it
