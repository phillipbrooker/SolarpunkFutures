SOLARPUNK FUTURES

Haziasoft



A device/game for thinking through some preposterous problems to do with:

    

* the relationship of social research to meaningful positive change
    
* the role of technologies in informing the practices of social life
    
* the possibility of supporting resistance and activism through design/games
    
* ...more?
    


None of this may work, it might all be a dead end, but it's an attempt to

apply some skills and expertises I have to something genuine and important.


¯\_(ツ)_/¯

TO DO LIST:

    

* Modularise out the scenario/memo data
    
* Write another stage in a game round, yearly net +/- everyday resource usage
    
* Design and 3D print the case (and test it's OK for the device)
    
* Write a game manual, change About screen to link to it
